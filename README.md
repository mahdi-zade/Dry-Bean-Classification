# Dry Bean Classification

## Aim
The aim of this repository is to start from scratch and build simple neural networks to classify bean images. at each step, the model and the parameters will be changed to check up the effect of each one the final result and hopefuly try achieving the best result in the end. This project is the perfect fit for anyone who is new to the field of machine learning and wants to have a better understanding of /neural network architecture.

## Dataset
You can access the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)
- Contains images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans.
- The images were taken with a high-resolution camera.
- A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
- This means there are 7 labels and 16 features.

## Part one: A two layer neural network








فقط اونجایی که گفته از scratch بزن نمیخواد با همین کتاب خونه ها آماده بزن

سوال اول شبکه عصبی mlp ساده است

سوال دوم convention ساده
